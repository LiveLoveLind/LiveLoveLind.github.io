                Chelsea officiated our wedding on August 7th, 2021 and did a wonderful job!
                She created a beautiful, personalized ceremony for my husband and I.
                She got to know us beforehand and created a script that reflected our love story and our goofy personalities.
                Chelsea helped with our vows for the ceremony as well. She's awesome!

                We are so so happy that we met Chelsea and got to share our special day with her!!
                We were literally lost about what direction we were going for an Officiant before we met her!
                EVERY SINGLE PERSON at our ceremony said that they'd never heard more beautiful vows and that
                they couldn't help from crying and that is a huge compliment to Chelsea,
                making sure Bear and I were on the same track and you taking the time to truly understand our journey to marriage!!
                I will be sure to share her information with any one that I know looking for Officiant services!

                We couldn't have asked for a better officiate than Chelsea! She met with us multiple times to get an idea of what we wanted. When we expressed an unique request, Chelsea did the research on how to make it work. She created several examples for how the ceremony could go, and she advised us on what she thought would work best when we were indecisive. Overall, she provided a professional, in-depth service that went above and beyond what I had expected.

                Chelsea was a joy and savior to work with during our wedding! She helped plan things out almost a year in advance, and when COVID restrictions hit the planning portion of the event, was very open and flexible with all of the changes those restrictions caused. 
                The weekend of the wedding, we had a few different events that she was a part of, and she was incredibly professional throughout the festivities! Chelsea had a schedule planned out on when people would speak, musical cues, and how everything should run during the big day!
                We honestly could not have had our wedding without her help, support, and planning! It was tough given the circumstances and changes due to health concerns, and she helped make it perfect!

                Violetta and I cannot recommend Chelsea and Live Love Lind Weddings highly enough to officiate your wedding. She built our dream ceremony. We meet multiple times for her to get to know us and understand our love story. Chelsea helped us craft unique vows with multiple iterations until they were just right. She was always very professional, thoughtful, and responsive with her communications. It was a blessing to have Chelsea perform our ceremony and we could not be happier. It was truly a dream come true and Chelsea was a large reason for that. Absolutely would recommend to anyone.

                Chelsea is an absolute necessity for the perfect stress free wedding ceremony, full of emotion and magic. If you are looking for a personalized reception with a comfortable and confident marriage officiant; that can take you from zero knowledge of weddings to magical marriage, look no further-Chelsea with Live Love Lind Weddings is the only choice. 
                Chelsea is thorough in her review of your love story and intimate questionnaire vow starters---all of our favorite things were included so cleverly (Harry Potter, champagne, our love story, NYE). Our guests keep complimenting the ceremony saying it was the most personalized and thoughtful wedding they have been to. Chelsea emailed us multiple times  during the process to check in on our thoughts and questionnaires, and kept us on track with our wedding plan. This morning she emailed us to fully close the loop and tell us our marriage certificate is official, and we are now a real married couple ‚ù§. 
                Thank you so much, Chelsea at Live Love Lind Weddings.  We are so in love with each other, and this officiant. Look no further, choose this business.
