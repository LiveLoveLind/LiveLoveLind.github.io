                <h3>LiveLoveLind Ceremony Package - $500</h3>
                <p class="fst-italic"> The LiveLoveLind package ensures that the focus of the big day is, as it should
                  be, the unique love that you share as a couple!
                  We will work together to create a ceremony that reflects your personalities, your love story, and any
                  special elements you'd like to share with your guests.
                  From the welcome to the pronouncement and everything in between,
                  I will guide you through all the ceremony options during a one hour wedding workshop.
                  Once you've selected the elements you'd like to include, I will supply ideas for each facet and
                  customize each element to fit your vision.
                  Then, we will give your custom ceremony that personal touch!
                  Instead of pulling platitudes off the internet or from the wedding I did the week before,
                  I like to begin the ceremony by telling <em>your</em> love story. Thereâ€™s magic in how you met, fell
                  in love, and got engaged.
                  As your story unfolds, friends and family get to share in that magic and glimpse the love you have for
                  one another.
                  Your ceremony script will be available to you 24/7 via Google Docs, where we can collaberate and
                  adjust each part until every word is perfect.

                <p class="fst-italic">At LiveLoveLind, we've separated out our pricing for rehearsals for the convenience
                  of our couples.
                  We recognize not every wedding requires or desires one! So we leave it up to you. However,
                  I always recommend having a rehearsal. It's a great way to ensure your bridal party knows where to
                  stand,
                  how to face the camera, and various other tips that ensure a smooth processional.
                  It also gives us a chance to change up any last minute details so that the day is just as you want it!
                  <br><br>This package includes:
                </p>
                <ul data-rte-list="default">

                  <li>
                    <p>Talk through: I spend the first part introducing myself to the party and talking them through
                      your ceremony. I will not read the script word for word,
                      we'll save that for the day! But I highlight cues they need to know, and the general elements that
                      will take place.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Walk through: Next I guide the party through all the motions at 1/2 speed. I promise the first
                      walk through will look awkward! But, this will get out all the confusion. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Final Walk through: Now that everyone knows where they need to be, we repeat the processional
                      from the beginning and answer any final questions. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>This should take between 30- 45 minutes depending on the number of party members and complexity
                      of the ceremony.</p>
                  </li>
